# 30DaysInEurope
The purpose of the project was to create a text adventure game using Python and MySQL database. 
The name of the game is 30 days in Europe. The idea of the game is to show the Europe and experience different European cultures

In the game, a game player has a game character who is trying to travel and explore as many European countries as possible in 30 days.
The character gets points of each city, sight and spot in the city. While the character is travelling, the
game counts the costs of travelling and how many days there are left.
